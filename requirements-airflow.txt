# Airflow and Airflow-provider dependencies for this repo.
#
# Airflow itself is pinned to match the Docker image in `Dockerfile`.
# Provider versions should be installed using the official constraints file
# for that Airflow/Python version to avoid resolver breakage.
#
# Example:
#   pip install -r requirements-airflow.txt \
#     -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.1.3/constraints-3.10.txt
#
# If you bump AIRFLOW_VERSION or Python, update the constraints URL accordingly.
